# 🧮 Basic Calculator

A modern, responsive calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project was created as part of a front-end assignment to practice UI design, input handling, and JavaScript functionality.

# 🚀 Features

Basic Arithmetic Operations → Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), and Percentage (%).

Order of Operations (BODMAS) → Handled correctly using JavaScript evaluation.

**Memory Functions:**

1.&emsp;M+ → Add current result to memory.

2.&emsp;M- → Subtract current result from memory.

3.&emsp;MR → Recall memory value (can be used in expressions).

4.&emsp;MC → Clear memory.

**Extra Controls:**

1.&emsp;AC → Clear all.

2.&emsp;⌫ → Delete last character.

3.&emsp;00, 0, . → For precise input.

**Error Handling** → Division by zero and invalid inputs show "Error".

**Keyboard Support** → Use your keyboard (0-9, +, -, *, /, ., Enter, Backspace, Esc).

**Modern UI** → Glassmorphic style with hover & press effects.

# 🖥️ Usage

1.&emsp;Clone or download this repository.

&emsp;i.&emsp;Open index.html in any modern browser.

2.&emsp;Start calculating:

3.&emsp;Use mouse clicks on the buttons, or

4.&emsp;Use your keyboard for faster input.

# 📝 Example

1.&emsp;Enter 9 * 5, press M+.

&emsp;i.&emsp;Screen shows 45, value stored in memory.

2.&emsp;Enter 10 + 5, press = → 15.

3.&emsp;Press MR → Memory value 45 is inserted.

4.&emsp;Expression becomes 15 + 45.

# 🎯 Learning Outcomes

1.&emsp;DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

2.&emsp;Handling both button and keyboard inputs.

3.&emsp;Implementing memory storage logic.

4.&emsp;Designing a modern, user-friendly calculator interface.
